### **Projectâ€‚1: [Heart Attack Prediction](https://github.com/KabbisB/KabbisB.github.io/blob/main/HeartAttackPredictionReport.pbix)**


----

**1. Tools Used**


**(a) Power BI for Loading andâ€‚Cleaning the Data**

- Power BI workedâ€‚well for this, it can load in data from multiple formats like excel or csv.
- It makes sure that data can beâ€‚processed smoothly.
  
**(b) Imputation of Missingâ€‚Values**

- The missing data were treated by the followingâ€‚methods:
- Missing value rows wereâ€‚dropped or imputed
- Gaps for categoricalâ€‚columns, such as *Diet*, were replaced with the most common value.
- For the numeric columns like *Cholesterol* or *Heart Rate*,â€‚the average was put in place of the missing values.
  
**(c) Transformation of Data**
  
-â€‚Power Query was used to transform the data. Using the following DAX formula, a newâ€‚measure for Risk Score was created:
  ```DAX
  Risk_Score = 
 (IF(VALUE([Cholesterol]) > 200,â€‚1, 0)) +
(IF(VALUE([Obesity]) = 1, 1,â€‚0)) +
(IF(VALUE([Smoking])â€‚= 1, 1, 0)) +
( IF( VALUE([Exercise Hours Perâ€‚Week]) <2, 1, 0 ))
  ```
- The above formula calculates a straightforward risk scoreâ€‚across several health factors.
- Other measures that we calculated withâ€‚DAX were:
  - Average BMI  
  - Average Cholesterol Levels
  - Average Risk Score  
  - Averageâ€‚Exercise Hours per Week
    
**(d) Data Formatting**

- Columns were properly labeled toâ€‚fulfill analysis requirements:
  
  **Continuous variablesâ€‚(Numbers):**
  
- Age, Cholesterol, Blood pressure
  
   **Categorical Variables:**
  
- Sex, Smoking, Diabetes, Heart Attack Risk

**2. Project Description**

With a datasetâ€‚with factors as such as age, medical history, and lifestyle choices, this project deals with making a heart attack risk prediction model. Designed a Power BI dashboard to help clinicians identify patients with high riskâ€‚and the top contributors in causing the heart attacks.


**3. Key Findings**

**Identifiedâ€‚Risk Factors**
â€” Smokers, people withâ€‚high cholesterol and those under stress were at a higher risk of heart attacks.
â€” Lack of exercise and obesity accounted for a considerable portion of theâ€‚increased risk.

**Model Impact**

â€” Theâ€‚heart risk scoring model helps healthcare workers to:
â€” Diagnoseâ€‚the high-risk people early.
â€” Intervene in aâ€‚timely manner and implement preventative measures.

**Actions You Can Take Right Now**

  - **Prevention:** Promote behavior change like greater amountsâ€‚of activity, cessation of smoking and reduced cholesterol levels
  - **Healthcare Policies:** Information from this model can help public health measures aimed at peopleâ€‚at risk.

**4. Dashboard Overview**

![HeartAttackDashboard](Dashboard.png)

**Power BI EDAâ€‚(Exploratory Data Analysis)**

This dashboard includes visuals which giveâ€‚insights into the data:

**(a) Line Graph**  

-â€‚**Risk Score Triglycerides vs Average Triglycerides:**

- The higher the triglycerides, the greater theâ€‚risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular disease.
- Triglycerides, a variety of fat in the blood,â€‚were positively associated with heart attack risk.
- This association was stronger among malesâ€‚which may be due to differences in lifestyle.
  
**(b) Donut Chart**

-â€‚**Average Riskâ€‚Score by Diet Type**:

- A healthy diet was linked toâ€‚a less risky score than an unhealthy diet.
- Perhaps note the most impressive, this effect of which are both Argentina and Colombiaâ€‚diets on heart attack rate.
  
**(c) Treemap**

-â€‚**Smoking, Obesity and Alcohol Consumption Combined:**

- This visualization highlighted how unhealthy lifestyles lead to heartâ€‚attacks.
â€“ Risk was sharply elevated in those who smoked,â€‚were obese, or consumed alcohol.

**(d) Mapâ€‚Visualization**

-â€‚**Topographyâ€‚of High-Risk Patients:**
  
- This map represents the number of high-risk patients across each country, with varying shades of color correspondingâ€‚to the average risk of heart attack.
  
**(e) Slicers forâ€‚Filter**

- **Sex**, **country**, and **ageâ€‚group** slices were added to filter and drill down into demographics.

**(f)â€‚Upper Part (KPIs)**

**KPI Cards:**  

- Average BMI: **27.5**  
- HDLâ€‚Cholesterol Risk Score: **<5**
- Cholesterol: **210â€‚mg/dL**
- Average Weeklyâ€‚Training Spend: **2.3 hours**
  





### **Projectâ€‚2:Moviesâ€‚Dataset Analysis Project â€” IMDB**

---

**Objective**

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory andâ€‚descriptive analysis on the top 1000 movies: the IMDB movie dataset. It contains extensive details about the movies such as ratings, directors, actors,â€‚genre, runtime, revenue, etc. In this analysis, we explore the movie data setâ€‚and answer some SQL based questions on it to gain insights on trend in movie industry and performances of actors and directors.


**Dataset Overview**

**1. Context**

IMDB Top 1000 Movies and TV Lists The data set contains 1000 movies andâ€‚TV lists. It could be helpful in understanding the factors that lead to the success of a movie and show including gross revenue versus votes,â€‚ratings versus directors and actors, etc.

**2. Content**

Here are the columnsâ€‚of the dataset:

| Column Name        | Description                                     â€‚                           |

| **Director** â€‚     | Names of the movie/TV show director. |
Star1â€‚| Star2 | Star3 | Star4 | Names of the main actors starring in the move. |
| **No_of_votes** | Totalâ€‚no. of votes received by the movie/show from IMDB. |
| **Gross** â€‚        | Total revenue received by the film (USD). |
